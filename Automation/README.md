## Project Description
You work as a video ad analyst at the Sterling & Draper advertising agency. You devote a lot of time to analyzing trending videos on YouTube to determine what content deserves marketing attention.
Each video has a specific category (Entertainment, Music, News & Politics, etc.), region, and trending date.
A video can be in the trending section for several days in a row.
Every week, the new employees Melanie and Ashok ask you the same questions:
What video categories were trending last week?
How were they distributed among various regions?
What categories were especially popular in the United States?
In your sixth week on the job, you decide that it's high time the process were automated. You're going to make a dashboard for Melanie and Ashok.
