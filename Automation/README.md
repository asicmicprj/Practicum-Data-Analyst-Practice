## Project Description
You work as a video ad analyst at the Sterling & Draper advertising agency. You devote a lot of time to analyzing trending videos on YouTube to determine what content deserves marketing attention.
Each video has a specific category (Entertainment, Music, News & Politics, etc.), region, and trending date.
A video can be in the trending section for several days in a row.
Every week, the new employees Melanie and Ashok ask you the same questions:
* What video categories were trending last week?
* How were they distributed among various regions?
* What categories were especially popular in the United States?
In your sixth week on the job, you decide that it's high time the process were automated. You're going to make a dashboard for Melanie and Ashok.
